# Cpp_MNIST_OCR_NN_in_a_weekend__MWE
This project is a Minimal Working Example (MWE) of a Neural Network OCR program for the MNIST data set, written in C++.
## Purpose & Credit
As a personal exercise I have created this repository with the purpose of building a Neural Network OCR from scratch in C++. As my main guide I've followed the blogpost [C++ Neural Network in a Weekend](https://www.jeremyong.com/cpp/machine-learning/2020/10/23/cpp-neural-network-in-a-weekend/)* by Jeremy Ong. It seemed like a very thouruohg and well written walkthrough, much credit to Mr. Ong.

## How to compile and run
### Prerequisites
 - C++ compiler (e.g. g++), with C++11 support
 - CMake version 3.8 or higher

### Build the project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project
3. Create a build directory: `mkdir build`
4. Run Cmake: 'cmake ..'
5. Build the project

After building the project, the executable `main` will be located in the `build` directory.
