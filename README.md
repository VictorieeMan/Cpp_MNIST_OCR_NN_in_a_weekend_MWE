# Cpp_MNIST_OCR_NN_in_a_weekend__MWE
This project is a Minimal Working Example (MWE) of a Neural Network OCR program for the MNIST data set, written in C++.
## Purpose & Credit
As a personal exercise I have created this repository with the purpose of building a Neural Network OCR from scratch in C++. As my main guide I've followed the blogpost [C++ Neural Network in a Weekend](https://www.jeremyong.com/cpp/machine-learning/2020/10/23/cpp-neural-network-in-a-weekend/)* by Jeremy Ong. It seemed like a very thouruohg and well written walkthrough, much credit to Mr. Ong.
