# my_first_cpp_NN_experiment

As a personal exercise I have created this repository with the purpose of building a Neural Network OCR from scratch in C++. As my main guide I've followed the blogpost [C++ Neural Network in a Weekend](https://www.jeremyong.com/cpp/machine-learning/2020/10/23/cpp-neural-network-in-a-weekend/) by Jeremy Ong. It seemed like a very thouruohg and well written walkthrough, much credit to Mr. Ong. My step one will be to follow it's guidance, and then when having some workign code I'll make an attempt in implementing some extra features, a convolutional layer for instance.
